App Name: DeFi Fee Consumption Tracker

Description:
DeFi Fee Consumption Tracker is a Mini App that monitors which DeFi protocols generate, burn, or distribute the most fees across various networks. Track real-time fee consumption, compare protocol efficiency, and identify which platforms are gaining traction based on economic activity. Receive alerts when fee generation spikes on key protocols.

Key Features:
 • Real-time tracking of fees generated across DeFi protocols
 • Insights into fee burning, distribution, and revenue mechanisms
 • Historical charts for fee trends and protocol growth
 • Alerts for sudden spikes in fee consumption
 • Dashboard to compare protocol performance and user activity

Use Case:
Ideal for DeFi users, analysts, and investors who want to understand which protocols drive the most on-chain economic activity and identify emerging high-usage platforms.
